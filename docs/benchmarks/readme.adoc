= Benchmarks

The benchmarks contained in this directory are setup to hit best through worst
case scenarios for the `bytify` functions. The same value is fed to both the
`bytify` and `strconv` function for the duration of each cycle.

This is done to get a better picture of the overall performance of the functions
for a more realistic sense of how the functions will behave in real-world
scenarios.

Each cycle consists of 10 million calls to each of the `bytify` and `strconv`
methods using the same input value for the entirety of the cycle.

== Comparisons

The following comparisons are based on the output data in this directory.

=== Create and Fill New Buffer

NOTE: The `Int64ToByteSlice` function presently executes as fast or marginally
slower (approximately 1ns) than the standard library function.  This function
is presently included for completeness and will hopefully be better tuned in
future releases.
