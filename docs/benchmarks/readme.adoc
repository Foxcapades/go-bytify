= Benchmarks

The benchmarks contained in this directory are setup to hit best through worst
case scenarios for the `bytify` functions.  Each cycle a value is selected from
the sets as defined below.  The same value is fed to both the `bytify` and
`strconv` function for the duration of each cycle.

This is done to get a wider picture of the performance of the functions for a
more realistic sense of how the functions will operate in practice.

== Value Sets

The following sets of values are fed sequentially to the tests, starting back
at the first value when the end of the list is reached.

=== Uints

The Uint functions are fed the following value sets of values:
